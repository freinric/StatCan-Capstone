# Segmentation of the Statistics Canada’s Set of Proximity Measures – A Clustering Algorithm Approach

The Data Exploration and Integration Lab (DEIL) at Statistics Canada is creating a new set of granular measures that assess local access to a variety of amenities such as libraries, parks, educational facilities, hospitals, and more. The measures are generated out of a gravity model approach, where the cost of transportation is weighted by the magnitude or importance of the entity they travel to. The measures are calculated at the dissemination block level in Canada. That is, around 500,000 unique geo-located units. The challenge for the UBC Capstone students will be to implement a clustering algorithm methodology for the segmentation of the measures.
